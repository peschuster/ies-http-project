Change Log for lwip
=================================
2012-04-15
	* In function init_dma in file xemacpsif_dma.c, the calls to
	Xil_DisableMMU and Xil_EnableMMU are removed. Now for changing
	attributes in the translation table, the only function called is
	Xil_SetTlbAttributes.

2012-03-12
	* In file xaxiemacif_dma.c, the function alloc_bdspace is updated
	so that the assert calls are under #if DEBUG statement. This is
	done to remove compilation issues with the new microblaze
	toolchain.
	Similar changes are done in xlltemacif_dma.c.

2012-03-12
	* In file xemacliteif.c the function xemacif_recv_handler is
	updated to free the pbufs upon error conditions (before returning
	back from the function).

2012-03-03
	* The SLCR divisor settings for GEM Tx clock for Zynq is now used
	from xparameters.h. Corresponding changes are made in
	src/contrib/ports/xilinx/netif/xemacpsif_physpeed.c.
	* Changes are made in src/contrib/ports/xilinx/sys_arch_raw.c for
	functions sys_arch_protect and sys_arch_unprotect. Earlier for
	Zynq/PEEP cases for sys_arch_protect we used to disable only the
	Emac interrupt and enable back it in sys_arch_unprotect. Now
	for Zynq all interrupts are disabled in CPSR (sys_arch_protect)
	and enabled back in sys_arch_unprotect.
	* Changes are made in src/contrib/ports/xilinx/netif/xemacpsif_dma.c
	for proper interrupt disabling and enabling for Tx. Also some
	optimizations are done to improve performance numbers.

2012-01-25
	* Following changes are made in file
	src/contrib/ports/xilinx/netif/xemacpsif_dma.c :
	Changes are made for Zynq/PEEP adapter so that the BDs are allocated
	at fixed addresses 0xFF00000 (for Rx Bds) and 0xFF10000 (for Tx Bds).
	The address range of 1 MB starting at 0xFF00000 is made uncached by
	setting attributes in the MMU table (in function init_dma).
	* Changes are made in
	src/contrib/ports/xilinx/netif/xemacpsif_physpeed.c to have separate
	PHY initializations for PEEP and Zynq boards.
	* Changes are made in src/contrib/ports/xilinx/sys_arch_raw.c. In
	function sys_arch_protect the EmacIntr is disabled instead of disabling
	the IRQ in CPSR. This change needs to be revisited later and a better
	solution needs to be adapted. Similar changes are done in
	sys_arch_unprotect.
	* DMA/GEM Error handling is added/changed for Zynq/PEEP. Hence changes
	are made in src/contrib/ports/xilinx/netif/xemacpsif.c and
	src/contrib/ports/xilinx/netif/xemacpsif_hw.c.
	* The MDIO divisor is set as 224 in file
	src/contrib/ports/xilinx/netif/xemacpsif_hw.c.
2011-11-18
	* Upgraded the to lwip140. Because of it there are lots of changes
	throughout the lwip files.
	* There was an existing bug because of which txperf used to hang
	after a few minutes. It is fixed in src/lwip-1.4.0/src/core/tcp_out.c.
	After entering into the function tcp_output, we disable interrupts
	and just before existing the function, we enable back the interrupts.
	This is done for microblaze and ppc platforms.
	* For lwip140 the semaphore, mutex, mailbox and pthread interfaces
	have changed. Corresponding changes are done in file sys_arch.c.
	* The functions SYS_ARCH_PROTECT and SYS_ARCH_UNPROTECT are now
	made as macros for better performance.
	* The file src/include/lwip/def.h is changed so that for endian
	swapping only macros are used instead of functions. This is done
	to have better performance.
	* Support for Zynq is added.
2011-08-29
	* src/makefile: Made changes not to echo files being compiled.
	* src/contrib/ports/xilinx/include/netif/xaxiemacif.h: Added function
	prototypes for PHY configuration.
	* src/contrib/ports/xilinx/include/netif/xlltemacif.h: Added function
	prototypes for PHY configuration.
	* src/contrib/ports/xilinx/netif/xadapter.c: Made changes in function
	xemacif_input to remove compilation warnings. The exact change is,
	replacing "return;" statements with "return 0;".
	* src/contrib/ports/xilinx/netif/xaxiemacif_dma.c: Removed the unused
	variable "csum_in_packet" in the function "is_checksum_valid".
	* src/contrib/ports/xilinx/netif/xaxiemacif_hw.c: Removed unused variables
	"rdy" and "lock_message_printed" in function "init_axiemac".
	The PHY configuration related code is removed from the function
	"init_axiemac", since it is now being done in a separate function.
	* src/contrib/ports/xilinx/netif/xaxiemacif_physpeed.c: The unused function
	"get_marvel_phy_speed" is removed.
	The function "get_IEEE_phy_speed" is changed to correctly advertise speeds
	and restart autonegotiation.
	A new function "configure_IEEE_phy_speed" is added to configure PHY speeds
	when autonegotiation is not done.
	A new function "Phy_Setup" is added to configure the PHY.
	Hash defines for PHY registers and PHY bit settings are added.
	* src/contrib/ports/xilinx/netif/xemacliteif: The function
	"low_level_init" is changed to start PHY autonegotiation when required
	and to set correct PHY speeds when autonegotiation is not being used.
	A new function "detect_phy_emaclite" is added to detect the PHY address
	connected.
	A new function "get_IEEE_phy_speed_emaclite" is added to correctly
	advertise relevant PHY speeds (1000 Mbps not advertised) and to restart
	PHY autonegotiation. This function returns the autonegotiated PHY speed.
	A new function "configure_IEEE_phy_speed_emaclite" is added to
	configure the proper PHY speed when PHY autonegotiation is not
	happenning.
	Hash defines for PHY registers and PHY bit settings are added.
	* src/contrib/ports/xilinx/netif/xlltemacif_hw.c:The PHY configuration
	related code is removed from the function "init_lltemac", since it is now
	being done in a separate function.
	* src/contrib/ports/xilinx/netif/xlltemacif_physpeed.c:The unused function
	"get_marvel_phy_speed" is removed.
	The function "get_IEEE_phy_speed" is changed to correctly advertise speeds
	and restart autonegotiation.
	A new function "configure_IEEE_phy_speed" is added to configure PHY speeds
	when autonegotiation is not done.
	A new function "Phy_Setup" is added to configure the PHY.
	Hash defines for PHY registers and PHY bit settings are added.
