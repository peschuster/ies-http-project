\chapter{Performance-Analysis}

\section{Methodology}

Network performance is often measured as I/O throughput in bits per second. While this gives a great insight in the capabilities of the network, there is no indication as to how many users can be served concurrently by a web server running on the system under test.

To gain insights in this performance parameter, dedicated tests on the top most protocol level used to communicate between clients (the users) and the server need to be performed. The used protocol at this level is HTTP \cite{http}.
