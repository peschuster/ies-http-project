\section{Methodology}

Network performance is often measured as I/O throughput in bits per second. While this gives a great insight in the capabilities of the network, there is no indication as to how many users can be served concurrently by a web server running on this system.

To gain insights in this performance parameter, dedicated tests on the HTTP protocol level need to be performed.
