\chapter{TCP Offload Engine}

\section{State of the Art}

\section{Benefits}

The conducted performance tests showed\footnote{see figures \ref{fig:initial-req-cpu} and \ref{fig:tcp-io-perf-cpu}} that much processing time is spend handling interrupt requests of the network sub system on TCP-heavy-requests.

Throughout recent years some attempts by companies manufacturing network interface cards were made to integrate support for TCP Offload Engines into the Linux kernel (e.g. by "Chelsio": \url{http://lwn.net/Articles/147289/})
